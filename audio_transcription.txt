[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Walk.

The moon

[Speaker 2]
Is actually fuck up.

[Speaker 1]
The rest rest.

[Speaker 2]
Awesome!

[Speaker 1]
For real.

[Speaker 2]
Un project. Evolutionary algorithms!

[Speaker 1]
Awesome, you know everything with evolutionary algorithms? Yeah, it's pretty. Pretty enjoyable. I think it's a class that I enjoyed in master bonus, although I suffer.

I think it was by far the most. Enjoy breakfast in my opinion.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, in recently in. Google created a model, a really powerful model that's called a super optimization agent that uses evolutionary algorithms. And it's like, top of the notch, like it has so like unsolved previous math problems.

[Speaker 1]
Really, it's crazy,

[Speaker 2]
I will give you the pitch after. I don't know how much time is there five seconds? Oh my God, five seconds.

[Speaker 1]
Wow, now we can work.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, welcome, second to me. Was

[Speaker 1]
Quite enjoyed. This is so freaking.

And when we're done with walking. Awesome!

So, let's walk together.

We can sit down.

Oh my

[Speaker 2]
God, so much time to sleep.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

Look, usually going

[Speaker 2]
Up the stairs. It's gonna continuously changing.

[Speaker 1]
Again.

[Speaker 2]
We're amazing, recommendous so much people.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so my personal plan is. I have to go to the shop.

You go to motest.

But yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
You essentially use reinforcement learning llms and the Revolutionary Computing so that you use the. Reinforcement learning to I need to consumption?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, but

[Speaker 2]
You use the reinforcement learning in order to. Things at the same time. Socially engaged. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Oh my God.

Yay! One of your interaction with me made you feel the rose yeah!

One more

[Speaker 2]
Time, uh, but it's basically the. The idea that you iteratively you give an llm a problem and it communicates between two llms and they find a way to solve the problem, and one of them tries to implement the problem, right? But the way that you search for Solutions is using an evolutionary algorithm, and you reinforce the things that are good,

[Speaker 1]
And it does

[Speaker 2]
This iteratively to solve problems. Okay,

[Speaker 1]
And it has been

[Speaker 2]
Used already to solve math problems like unsolved math problem.

[Speaker 1]
That's so.

[Speaker 2]
That's so cool. Yeah, what? Yeah, yeah. Del papas. Yay!
